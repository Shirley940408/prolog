/*
1. what fluents/predicates
2. what are the things that can happen?
3. write down a precondition axiom for each action, in this case, there is just one
poss([move(X, Y)| S]):-
    clear(X, S),
    clear(Y, S),
    block(X),
    block(Y),
    position(Y),...
4. foreach fluent write down successor state axiom.
    successor state axiom:
    on(X, Y, [A|S]):-
        poss([A|S]),
        (
            %becomming true with A
            A = move(X, _, Y);
            % was true and not becomming false
            on(X, Y, S),
            A \= move(X, _, Y).
        )
    clear(X, S):-\+on(_, X, S).
5. initial state
    on(a, 1, []).
    on(b, a []).
    on(c, 3, []).

% posOrBlock(X) is true if X is a position or a block
posOrBlock(X) :- block(X);position(X).

% Poss(move(B, X, Y),S) is true if Block B could be moved from Position X to % Position Y based % on the situation S

%plan(g(S),S) is true when g(S) is a formula (the goal state depending on S) that is true, and S is an action history (the plan)
plan(Goal,Plan):-bposs(Plan),Goal.

%bposs(S) is true when S is a sequence of possible actions considering shortest sequences first
bposs(S) :- tryposs([],S). 
% tryposs(S,S) is true when S is a sequence of possible actions considering shortest sequences first (breadth first search for possible action sequences)
